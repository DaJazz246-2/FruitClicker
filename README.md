# FruitClicker
A simple clicker game that's all about fruit!

Made by Jayden Collis for a friend.

To run on windows, go to releases and download the source code zip, extract it and run the exe file. On linux you have to run the code in a Python IDE. Its not updated to match windows either.

For the record, this game is nowhere near complete at this moment in time. However, I am actively working on this. Stay tuned!
