# FruitClicker
A simple clicker game that's all about fruit!

Made by Jayden Collis for a friend.

To run, double click the main.py file in the correct folder according to your os. Alternatively, open the file in a python 
editor and press F5 (or Run).

For the record, this game is nowhere near complete at this moment in time. However, I am actively working on this. Stay tuned!
